# Supabase Configuration

#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a TEMPLATE file

# ## For Project Owner (Co-Developer who creates the Supabase account):
# 1. Create Supabase account at https://supabase.com
# 2. Create new project (name: "Manuscript Alert Production")
# 3. Get your API keys from Project Settings → API
# 4. Replace the placeholder values below with YOUR keys
# 5. Share these credentials with team members via SECURE channel (Signal, 1Password)

# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Get credentials from project owner (co-developer)
# 3. Replace placeholder values with credentials from project owner
