However, most cases of Alzheimer's disease are associated with multiple neuropathologies at autopsy. The peripheral protein changes associated with these disease endophenotypes are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the plasma proteomes of individuals from four cohorts (n = 2,139 participants) to identify proteins and pathways associated with cerebral β-amyloidosis and other neuropathologies, including tau, Lewy bodies, TDP43, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis and infarcts as well as cognitive function. Analyses in a cohort with paired brain data showed that known neuropathologies could account for only half of proteins associated with cognitive function and that many plasma proteins associated with these neuropathologies are not strongly correlated to levels in brain, suggesting a potential contribution of peripheral factors to the development of Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes.

However, the MSE effects on brain health and dementia are unknown. We evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from a non-representative sample across six Latin American countries. Adverse exposomes associate with poorer cognition in healthy aging. In dementia, more complex exposomes correlate with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity alterations in frontal-temporal-limbic and cerebellar regions. Food insecurity, financial resources, subjective socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare emerge as critical predictors.

Migrasomes are organelles that form during cellular migration, detach from parent cells and mediate intercellular communication. Here we demonstrate that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) acquire senescence-associated properties during early brain aging, possibly due to prolonged exposure to amyloid beta. Senescent-like BAMs show elevated production of migrasomes, which convey senescence-associated signals including the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage to neighboring cells. We show that microglia are prominent recipients of senescent-like BAM-derived migrasomes, and that through activation of CD16 in recipient cells, the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage inhibits apoptosis and promotes senescence induction. Blocking migrasome induction in senescent-like BAMs through treatment with Tspan4-targeting siRNA-encapsulated liposomes ameliorates cognitive deficits in aged mice.

Plasma phosphorylated Tau217 (p-tau217) is the front-runner candidate for AD diagnosis due to its strong correlation with core AD pathology determined either by cerebrospinal fluid biomarker (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) or postmortem examination. While plasma p-tau217 is firmly associated with AD pathology, it is crucial to evaluate its performance in distinguishing AD from mixed pathologies, as brain autopsies have shown the coexisting of AD pathology with other related types of dementia. Moreover, the measurement of AD biomarkers will be a crucial element in defining eligibility for disease-modifying treatment in clinical practice. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 is a highly efficacious biomarker in the early detection of Aβ pathology, making it a feasible test for AD screening in clinical practice. Several assays, including the ALZpath p-tau217 assay and the Fujirebio plasma p-tau217 assay, have been made commercially available for research use.

Structural MRI (sMRI) is a key imaging modality for detecting AD-related brain atrophy, yet traditional deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to capture complex spatial dependencies critical for AD diagnosis. This study introduces the Regional Attention-Enhanced Vision Transformer (RAE-ViT), a novel framework designed for AD classification using sMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. RAE-ViT leverages regional attention mechanisms to prioritize disease-critical brain regions, such as the hippocampus and ventricles, while integrating hierarchical self-attention and multi-scale feature extraction to model both localized and global structural patterns. Evaluated on 1152 sMRI scans (255 AD, 521 MCI, 376 NC), RAE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94.2 % accuracy, 91.8 % sensitivity, 95.7 % specificity, and an AUC of 0.96, surpassing standard ViTs (89.5 %) and CNN-based models (e.g., ResNet-50: 87.8 %). The model's interpretable attention maps align closely with clinical biomarkers (Dice: 0.89 hippocampus, 0.85 ventricles), enhancing diagnostic reliability. Robustness to scanner variability (92.5 % accuracy on 1.5T scans) and noise (92.5 % accuracy under 10 % Gaussian noise) further supports its clinical applicability. A preliminary multimodal extension integrating sMRI and PET data improved accuracy to 95.8 %. Future work will focus on optimizing RAE-ViT for edge devices, incorporating multimodal data (e.g., PET, fMRI, genetic), and exploring self-supervised and federated learning to enhance generalizability and privacy.

Genetic and environmental factors affect iron deposition, but underlying mechanisms are unclear.ObjectiveIdentify risk factors and diseases associated with brain iron; assess causality using genetics.Methods41,581 UK Biobank participants had MRI-estimated brain iron (QSM method) in five dementia or PD-associated subcortical regions (caudate, hippocampus, putamen, substantia nigra, thalamus). We investigated common risk factors (including adiposity, blood pressure, health behaviors, inflammation) and diseases observationally, using covariate-adjusted regression models, and genetically, with Mendelian randomization.ResultsParticipants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, PD, or other diseases had higher MRI-estimated brain iron. Anemia, osteoporosis, and hyperparathyroidism were associated with lower brain iron. Higher body mass index and blood pressure, smoking history, and self-reported meat consumption, increased brain iron. Hematological parameters, inflammatory and kidney biomarkers, and calcium, were also associated. Genetics support causal effects of depression, type-2 diabetes, and 7 other diseases with increased iron, but not Alzheimer's disease. Evidence supports a causal effect of osteoporosis on lower iron in the substantia nigra. We found causal associations between adiposity and proteins (including IL-6 receptor and transferrin receptor) on subcortical brain iron.ConclusionsWe identified causal effects for liability to type-2 diabetes, depression, and other conditions, on subcortical MRI-estimated brain iron, but not to Alzheimer's disease, supportive of dementia as a consequence of brain iron deposition, not a cause.

Comprehensive quantitative proteomics of brain tissues from AD patients is critical for pursuing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive AD progression. Here, we present one of the first quantitative top-down proteomics (TDP) studies of postmortem cortex samples from AD patients and healthy controls to profile their proteoform differences by coupling capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE, liquid-phase ion mobility) to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We identified 3191 unique proteoforms and uncovered a drastic transformation in the proteoform profile in AD compared to healthy controls. Over 2200 proteoforms were exclusively identified in either AD or healthy control samples, and 157 proteoforms identified in both AD and control samples showed statistically significant abundance differences between the two conditions. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis of the genes associated with those proteoforms revealed broad changes in biological processes in AD brains, for example, telomere organization, substantia nigra development, amyloid fibril formation, microtubule cytoskeleton organization, progressive neurological disorders, long-term synaptic potentiation, and axogenesis. These biological processes are highly associated with the development of AD. Our study revealed a pool of potential novel proteoform biomarkers of AD in human brain samples for early diagnosis and therapy development. SUMMARY: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, destroying brain cells and causing thinking ability and memory to decline over time. Proteins (e.g., amyloid and tau) play key roles in the development of AD. Global and accurate protein measurement of human brains of AD patients and healthy controls will shed new light on the molecular mechanisms driving AD progression and discover new biomarkers for AD diagnosis and therapeutic development. Here, we performed the first CZE-MS/MS-based quantitative top-down proteomics (TDP) of a small cohort of AD human brain samples and healthy controls (5 AD and 5 control) to determine the differentially quantified proteoforms between the two health conditions. Over 3000 proteoforms were identified, and only about 700 proteoforms were detected in both conditions, indicating drastically different proteoform profiles between the two conditions. The differentially quantified proteoforms (e.g., tau, neurogranin, and calmodulin-1 proteoforms) are associated with biological processes relevant to AD development, for example, amyloid fibril formation, microtubule disruption, synaptic transmission, and axogenesis.

The failure of the neuronal proteostasis network a system critical for preventing toxic protein aggregation is a fundamental pathological process in AD. Molecular chaperones, which are deficient in the AD brain, represent a compelling therapeutic target. A major obstacle has been delivering large biologics like chaperones across the blood-brain barrier. Engineered exosomes offer a promising platform for neuron-specific delivery of nucleic acid cargo.

ObjectiveThe primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intracisternal dose of NV-101, an autologous dendritic cell-derived exosome engineered with neuron-targeting peptides and DNAJB6 mRNA, compared to placebo in participants with early AD. Secondary objectives are to assess its biological activity through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

MethodsThe RESTORE trial is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study. Eighteen participants with biomarker-confirmed early AD will be enrolled across three sequential dose cohorts (Low, Medium, High). Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either NV-101 or placebo (excipient buffer) via a single intracisternal magna injection. The primary outcome is the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events over 52 weeks.

Brain MRI plays an integral role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cognitive symptoms. When interpreting brain MRI for cognitive impairment, radiologists should assess the following four key features: (1) white matter ischemic burden, (2) structural changes to suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus, (3) locoregional pattern of brain atrophy, and (4) presence of microhemorrhage or superficial siderosis, particularly for determining eligibility for anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (MAB) treatment when appropriate. The recent approval and clinical adoption of anti-amyloid MAB expanded the role of neuroradiologists in evaluating eligibility and monitoring ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormality) among patients receiving anti-amyloid MAB. This advancement underscores the importance of standardized imaging protocols and effective communication between neuroradiologists and cognitive neurologists. Depending on the severity of ARIA and patients' symptoms, treatment may need to be suspended or discontinued. This review article explores brain MRI and FDG-PET/CT imaging abnormalities in patients with major cognitive and movement disorders associated with dementia. It aims to assist radiologists in providing differential diagnoses within a clinical context. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of recognizing co-pathologies, since patients may have more than one neurodegenerative disease rather than viewing these neurodegenerative diseases as being mutually exclusive. KEY POINTS: Question Traditional regional patterns of brain atrophy on MRI by neuroradiologists may not be effective given the recent advances in understanding of neurodegenerative disease and recognition of co-pathologies. Findings The locoregional atrophy and the patterns of metabolic abnormality help in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. Remember that brain MRI determines eligibility for anti-amyloid immunotherapy.

However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. Here we explore whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (Aβ) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). We include 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both Aβ pathology (CSF Aβ42/40 or neocortical Aβ-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), categorising them as left asymmetric (n = 102), symmetric (n = 306), or right asymmetric (n = 44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. We assess edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n = 318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n = 352) but find no association between tau asymmetry and connectivity. In contrast, we observe a strong association between tau and Aβ laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n = 233; β = 0.632, p < 0.001), which we replicate in three independent cohorts (n = 234; β = 0.535, p < 0.001). In a longitudinal Aβ-positive sample, we show that baseline Aβ asymmetry predicts progression of tau laterality over time (n = 289; β = 0.025, p = 0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to Aβ pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology.",2025-09-05,PubMed,Nature communications,16,1,11.2,"Alzheimer's disease, PET, amyloid, tau, brain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40913038/,40913038,10.1038/s41467-025-63564-2

Traditional morphological MRI metrics, such as cortical volume and thickness, only partially relate to functional impairment and disease trajectories at the individual level. Emerging research has increasingly focused on reconstructing interregional meso- and macro-structural relationships in the brain by analysing covarying morphometric patterns. These patterns suggest that structural variations in specific brain regions tend to covary with deviations in other regions across individuals, a phenomenon termed structural covariance. This concept reflects the idea that physiological and pathological processes follow an anatomically defined spreading pattern. Advanced computational strategies, particularly those within the graph-theoretical framework, yield quantifiable properties at both the whole-brain and regional levels, which correlate more closely with the clinical state or cognitive performance than classical atrophy patterns. This review highlights cutting-edge methods for evaluating morphometric covariance networks on an individual basis, with a focus on their utility in characterizing ageing, central nervous system inflammation and neurodegeneration. Specifically, these methods hold significant potential for quantifying structural alterations in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia and multiple sclerosis. By capturing the distinctive morphometric organization of each individual's brain, structural covariance network analyses allow the tracking and prediction of pathology progression and clinical outcomes, information that can be integrated into clinical decision-making and used as variables in clinical trials. Furthermore, by investigating distinct and cross-diagnostic patterns of structural covariance, these approaches offer insights into shared mechanistic processes critical to understanding severe neurological disorders and their therapeutic implications.

The most commonly used plasma biomarkers include amyloid-β (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The extent to which distinct profiles of multiple plasma biomarkers correlate with common neuropathologies is unclear. Using clinicopathologic data from 405 community-dwelling older adults, we applied latent profile analysis to four plasma biomarkers, i.e. Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau217, NfL and GFAP, and examined the correlates of the latent profiles with four degeneration measures: AD, Lewy bodies, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and hippocampal sclerosis; and five vascular measures: chronic macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. On average, participants died at the age of 89, and blood samples for plasma biomarkers were measured 3.9 years before death. Over 75% were female, and 24% were non-Latino Black. We observed three distinct biomarker profiles. Profile 1, characterized by low p-tau217, low GFAP, low NfL and high Aβ42/40, represented most participants (55.6%), with better than average biomarker levels. Both Profile 2 and Profile 3 showed worse than average biomarker levels. Profile 2, representing 34.8% of the participants, was high in p-tau217 and GFAP. In contrast, Profile 3, representing 9.6% of the participants, was high in NfL and GFAP. Examination of neuropathologic correlates of these plasma biomarker profiles revealed that Profile 2 exemplifies older adults with a high burden of neurodegeneration; almost all participants (92.9%) in Profile 2 had a diagnosis of pathologic AD, and the group also had the highest percentage of participants with Lewy bodies (41.1%). In comparison, Profile 3 exemplifies older adults with more severe vascular conditions; participants in this group had the highest percentage of macroscopic infarcts (31.6%) and moderate or severe atherosclerosis (42.1%).

However, conventional MRI neuroimaging, mainly focussed on grey matter volume and thickness, has failed to establish whether underlying processes differ between them. Understanding these differences could enable targeted and subtype-specific treatments to be developed. We applied quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), an advanced neuroimaging technique sensitive to tissue iron, to examine differences in tissue composition between these Lewy body dementia subtypes. We performed both voxel-wise and region of interest analyses to compare QSM values in 66 people with Lewy body dementia (45 DLB; 21 PDD); 86 people with Parkinson's disease with normal cognition (PD-NC) and 37 healthy controls. We also assessed relationships between QSM values and measures of both cognitive performance and overall disease severity in people with Lewy body dementia. We found that people with Lewy body dementia had higher QSM values in widespread brain regions, compared with cognitively-normal people with PD; and that people with PDD had higher QSM values across many brain regions, compared with people with DLB. Further, we showed a positive relationship between QSM values and overall disease severity, measured using the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale in people with Lewy body dementia, in right thalamus, left pallidum, bilateral substantia nigra, bilateral middle frontal, temporal and lateral occipital lobes, right precentral and superior frontal cortices. In a region of interest analysis, we showed that people with PDD had higher QSM values than cognitively-normal people with PD and controls in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Our findings indicate neurobiological differences between subtypes of Lewy body dementia, that can be detected by exploiting QSM's sensitivity to tissue composition. Based on this, DLB and PDD could be considered as distinct conditions in the clinic and in clinical trials, and may respond to different treatments.

Vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes, a key vascular cell type, may play a key role. In model organisms, sleep disruption is associated with pericyte dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) technology have identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of pericytes: extracellular matrix protein-expressing M-pericytes and solute carrier-expressing T-pericytes. However, the relationship between sleep, pericyte biology and cognition in humans remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the composition of brain pericyte subpopulations, as inferred from marker gene expression, may link sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline. We leveraged two published human brain snRNAseq datasets to identify specific marker genes for M- and T-type pericytes. We then used post-mortem bulk RNAseq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 1092) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (n = 495) to quantify expression of these marker genes in older adults in two longitudinal cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We derived trajectories of global cognitive function from participants' ante-mortem annual cognitive assessments, while sleep fragmentation was derived from ante-mortem wrist-actigraphy recordings from a subset of 572 participants. We used multivariate linear regression to relate pericyte marker gene expression to sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline in the decade preceding death. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, greater average sleep fragmentation was associated with greater expression of M-pericyte marker genes [estimate = +3.65 × 10-1, standard error (SE) = 1.61 × 10-1, P = 0.024] but not T-pericyte marker genes. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression of M-pericyte (estimate = -8.30 × 10-3, SE = 3.37 × 10-3, P = 0.014) but not T-pericyte marker genes was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the 10 years prior to death. In the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater composite M-pericyte gene expression (estimate = + 4.48 × 10-1, SE = 1.92 × 10-1, P = 0.02), which in turn was associated with faster cognitive decline in the decade preceding death (estimate = -1.30 × 10-2, SE = 4.55 × 10-3, P = 0.0044).

However, the factors triggering initial tau deposition in the EC remain unclear. We propose a novel biomechanical cascade hypothesis, positing that the unique anatomical inferomedial positioning of the EC, including proximity to the tentorial incisura (TI) and other skull base structures, renders it susceptible to very mild yet persistent age-related mechanical stress, analogous to the effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, triggering tau pathology.

These symptoms severely reduce the quality of life for patients and impose a significant burden on caregivers. The existing therapies offer only symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying silent pathological progression. This therapeutic gap has catalysed interest in alternative pathological pathways, particularly the dysregulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) homeostasis and associated metabolic dysfunctions. Traditionally viewed as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder, AD is now increasingly understood to involve peripheral organs, notably the liver, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of systemic and cerebral homeostasis. Emerging evidence highlights the liver's involvement in the clearance of Aβ, as well as in the modulation of oxidative stress, brain energy metabolism, insulin resistance, microtubule dynamics, and neuroinflammation, the key features of AD pathogenesis. Among the hepatic factors implicated, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is of particular interest. LRP-1 facilitates peripheral Aβ clearance and is also expressed abundantly in key brain regions such as the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Beyond neurons, LRP-1 is localized in activated astrocytes, microglia, and various elements of the neurovascular unit, including brain endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and the choroid plexus-highlighting its critical role at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Activation of hepatic LRP-1 has been shown to attenuate key neuropathological processes in AD, including oxidative stress, insulin resistance, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. These effects not only improve short-term neuronal resilience but also contribute to long-term neuroprotection. Taken together, these findings underscore the significance of the liver-brain axis, positioning hepatic LRP-1 as a central mediator of AD pathology.

Although several disease-modifying treatments have recently become available, their effects remain limited, as they primarily delay rather than halt disease progression. Thus, the early and accurate identification of individuals at elevated risk for conversion to AD dementia is crucial to maximize the effectiveness of these therapies and to facilitate timely intervention strategies. Baseline plasma concentrations of amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and tau phosphorylated at residue 181 and 217 (pTau181, pTau217) were quantified in 233 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and followed for up to 11 years. Covariates included demographic variables and neuropsychological measures. Longitudinal cognitive trajectories were modelled with linear mixed-effects models (LMM), and the risk of progression to AD dementia was evaluated with logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards analyses. Longitudinally, higher baseline plasma levels of GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 independently predicted steeper cognitive decline. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated significant associations of pTau217, pTau181, and Aβ42 with baseline memory impairment. A logistic regression model incorporating five plasma biomarkers-Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217-demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for discrimination of future converters to AD dementia. The addition of demographic variables and a baseline memory score further improved model specificity and positive predictive value. These findings support the utility of a concise plasma biomarker panel comprising Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 for predicting both longitudinal cognitive deterioration and conversion to AD dementia. This less-invasive blood-based panel could serve as a practical triage tool to enrich clinical trials and facilitate timely therapeutic interventions with emerging disease-modifying treatments.",2025-09-06,PubMed,GeroScience,,,5.4,"Alzheimer's disease, dementia, amyloid, tau, plasma",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40914747/,40914747,10.1007/s11357-025-01869-2

PD neuropathology is due to the progressive deposition of mutant alpha synuclein (α-Syn) in the dopaminergic neurons (DNs) of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Additionally, amyloid protein (Aβ) and tau protein, which are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are also involved in PD and the development of PD-related dementia. Notably, α-Syn, Aβ, tau protein, and neuronal cholesterol metabolism are regulated by a transmembrane protein, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which is highly expressed in the SNpc and mediates the transmission and seeding of α-Syn in the brain. It has been reported that deletion of the LRP1 gene protects against the development and progression of PD. However, LRP1 has a neuroprotective effect against AD neuropathology by improving Aβ clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enhancing tau protein proteolysis. Nevertheless, the exact role of LRP1 in PD neuropathology, mostly about α-Syn, is not completely explained. Therefore, this review aims to discuss and explain the role of LRP1 in PD and how targeting neuronal LRP1 may be helpful in the management of PD. In this review, online databases were involved by searching Scopus, Web of Science, and other search engine to detect the relationship between the expression of LRP1 and the pathogenesis of PD.",2025-09-05,PubMed,European journal of pharmacology,1002,,5.2,"Alzheimer's disease, dementia, amyloid, tau, brain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40484331/,40484331,10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.177830

Pathogenic mutations in OPTN have also been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and glaucoma, supporting its role in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its established biological roles, knowledge about its potential contribution to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuronal functioning is lacking. AD is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles, with dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway exacerbating tau pathology and impairing proteostasis. To investigate the role of OPTN in neuronal proteostasis and AD, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron (iN) and astrocyte (iA) models. Analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between OPTN and specific pTau epitopes in neurons, as well as a decrease in OPTN protein abundance in brain tissues of individuals with AD. Given these findings, we generated OPTN knockout (KO), heterozygous, and wildtype iNs and iAs using CRISPR/Cas9 editing of iPSCs in two genetic backgrounds. Loss of OPTN in iNs increased specific pTau proteoforms without substantially affecting autophagy processes or mitochondrial respiration. Despite no clear effect on mitochondrial function, several mitochondrial proteins, including OXCT1, were enriched in an unbiased analysis of the OPTN interactome in iNs, as well as proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. Proteomic analyses further identified intracellular clusterin, an AD risk gene, as significantly upregulated in OPTN KO iNs, suggesting OPTN may influence its intracellular processing. Our model system demonstrates modest roles for OPTN in certain neuronal biological processes and potential implications for AD pathogenesis. These findings also suggest that OPTN may exhibit functional redundancy with other autophagy adaptor proteins in human neurons, leading to relatively mild phenotypic changes with complete loss of OPTN.",2025-09-02,PubMed,Acta neuropathologica communications,13,1,5.2,"Alzheimer's disease, dementia, amyloid, tau, brain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40898372/,40898372,10.1186/s40478-025-02103-y

Despite two-thirds of dementia cases occurring in the Global South, research on BBMs has predominantly focused on populations from the Global North. This geographical disparity hinders our understanding of BBM performance in diverse populations. To address this, we evaluated the diagnostic properties of AD BBMs in a real-world memory clinic from Brazil, one of the largest countries in the Global South. We measured blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers - amyloid-β (Aβ)40, Aβ42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217, neurofilament light (NfL) chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) - in 59 individuals. Sample comprised 20 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 22 with AD dementia, and 17 with vascular dementia (VaD). We compared BBM levels across diagnostic groups and assessed their discriminative ability for AD. Notably, individuals with VaD and AD had lower educational levels (6.8 ± 3.0) compared to CU individuals (17.3 ± 6.9). Among the BBMs tested, plasma p-tau217 demonstrated the best performance, exhibiting high accuracy in differentiating CU from AD (AUC 0.96) and Aβ pathology (AUC 0.98). However, the ability of AD BBMs to distinguish between AD and VaD was lower than expected (AUC from 0.52-0.79), particularly when compared to studies from the Global North. Our findings highlight the potential utility of BBMs for AD diagnosis in real-world settings within Brazil.

Despite the rapid emergence of blood-based biomarkers, neuroimaging continues to be a vital area of research in ADRD. Here, we discuss neuroimaging as a powerful tool to topographically visualize and quantify amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and vascular disease in the brain. We examine the utility of neuroimaging for (1) tracking the spatiotemporal progression of pathology, (2) serving as the reference standard for validating novel fluid biomarkers, (3) characterizing disease heterogeneity, (4) exploring the role of brain networks in ADRD progression, and (5) evaluating biomarkers for better individualized estimates of treatment benefit. Finally, we discuss advances in radiotracer development and AD risk factors. By reviewing the most promising breakthroughs in the neuroimaging field, we hope to spark new ideas for future discoveries that will deepen our understanding of ADRD.

This article reviews the latest advances in PET technologies aimed at visualizing neurodegenerative proteinopathies, and highlights the importance of these technologies for emerging diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. PET allows Aβ deposition to be visualized throughout the natural history of AD and following anti-Aβ immunotherapies. However, whether this technology can visualize specific Aβ assembly subspecies primarily targeted by the treatment remains inconclusive.

Recent animal studies reveal that the activation of peripheral TREM2 signaling may affect cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau aggregates. However, the underlying relationship between peripheral TREM2 and brain AD pathology has not yet been well-elucidated in the aging population. In this study, we collected 318 Chinese older adults with Aβ PET and plasma biomarker measures, including soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a proxy for astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, 129 participants underwent tau PET scans. We explored the association between plasma sTREM2, GFAP, and primary AD pathology. Plasma sTREM2 was negatively associated with reduced temporal tau PET burden in participants with abnormal Aβ and tau pathology. Higher plasma sTREM2 was related to the weaker association of Aβ pathology and plasma phosphorylated tau with tau PET increases. In contrast, elevated plasma GFAP was related to greater Aβ and tau PET burden along with stronger Aβ-related tau accumulation. Finally, higher plasma sTREM2 was linked to attenuated strength of the association between plasma GFAP and tau PET increases at both pre-defined regions of interest and voxel levels.

Conventional cutoff determination relies on invasive or costly gold-standards, limiting scalability. This study evaluated Finite Mixture Modelling (FMM) for establishing cutoffs without gold-standards. FMM was applied to derive cutoffs for Lumipulse plasma p-Tau217 and p-Tau217/Aβ42 ratio among 1039 ADNI participants, with validation conducted in a subset with amyloid PET data (n = 711). Additionally, simulations were conducted to determine the minimum sample size for reliable FMM estimation. The results showed that FMM-derived cutoffs effectively classified participants into brain amyloid-negative, -positive, and -indeterminate groups, with an indeterminate proportion <20 %, negative and positive predictive values near or above 90 %, and with p-Tau217/Aβ42 outperforming p-Tau217. These FMM-derived cutoffs demonstrated test performance that surpassed several previously-established cutoffs, including the recent FDA-approved cutoff. At least 900 samples were needed for reliable cutoff estimation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of a modelling approach for estimating plasma p-Tau217 cutoffs without reliance on gold-standards.

S.; Brown...","While tau pathology is closely associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD), our prior work using multi-modality imaging revealed that mismatch between tau (T) and neurodegeneration (N) may reflect contributions from non-AD processes. The medial temporal lobe (MTL), an early site of AD pathology, is also a common target of co-pathologies such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), often following an anterior-posterior atrophy gradient. Given the susceptibility of MTL to co-pathologies, here we explored T-N mismatch specifically within MTL using plasma ptau217 and MTL morphometry for identifying vulnerabilities and resilience in cognitively impaired or unimpaired AD patients.

We parcellated the MTL into 100 spatially contiguous segments and calculated their T-N mismatch using plasma ptau217 as a measure for T and thickness as a marker of N. Based on these mismatch profiles, we clustered 447 amyloid-positive individuals from ADNI cohort into data-driven T-N phenotypes. We characterized the T-N phenotypes by examining their cross-sectional and longitudinal atrophy both within the MTL and across the whole brain, as well as cognitive trajectories. This framework was replicated in an independent cohort and finally translated to a real-world clinical sample of 50 patients undergoing anti-amyloid therapy.

Clustering identified three T-N phenotypes with different MTL T-N mismatch profiles, atrophy patterns, and cognitive outcomes, despite comparable AD severity. The ""canonical"" group, characterized by low T-N residuals (N [~] T), showed AD-like neurodegeneration patterns. The ""vulnerable"" group, characterized by disproportionately greater neurodegeneration than tau (N > T), showed atrophy primarily in the anterior MTL that extended into temporal-limbic regions, both in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. This group also exhibited neurodegeneration that preceded estimated tau onset and experienced faster cognitive decline across multiple domains, aligning with the typical characteristics of mixed LATE-NC with AD. In contrast, the ""resilient"" group (N < T) showed minimal atrophy and preserved cognitive function. These phenotypes were reproducible in an independent research cohort. Importantly, in a feasibility study applying the model developed from ADNI to a clinical cohort of patients receiving lecanemab, we identified vulnerable individuals with LATE-like atrophy patterns. This highlights its potential utility for identifying individuals with co-pathology in clinical settings.

Our findings demonstrate that T-N mismatch within MTL using MRI and plasma biomarkers can reveal AD groups with varying vulnerability/resilience, with the vulnerable group displaying structural and cognitive outcomes suggestive of LATE-NC.

Recent studies emphasize the gut-brain axis as a vital element in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, involving microbial, neuronal, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms. The composition of gut microbiota dysbiosis is determined by growth in intestinal barrier permeability and activation of immune cells, which causes impaired function of the blood-brain barrier that stimulates neural injury, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and eventually AD. Various studies have reported that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in brain function and changes in individual behavior, as well as in bacterial amyloid formation. Growing experimental and clinical data specify the conspicuous role of intestinal dysbiosis and microbiota- host interactions in AD.

A. Q.; Boyle, R.; Morse...","ObjectivePlasma biomarkers of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology are frequently tested in specialized research settings, limiting generalizability of findings. Using electronic health records and banked plasma, we evaluated plasma biomarkers - phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), {beta}-amyloid 1-42/1-40 (A{beta}42/A{beta}40) and p-tau217/A{beta}42 - in a real-world, diverse clinical population with multimorbidities.

MethodsParticipants (n=617; 44% Black/African American; 41% female) were selected from the University of Pennsylvania Medicine BioBank with plasma assayed using Fujirebio Lumipulse. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth and Tenth Revision codes determined AD dementia (ADD; n=43), mild-cognitive impairment (MCI; n=140), unspecified/non-AD cognitive impairment (CI; n=106), and cognitively normal cases (n=328), and other medical histories. APOE {varepsilon}4, body mass index (BMI), metrics of kidney function (e.g., eGFR), and liver disease were derived from electronic health records. Multivariable models identified factors related to plasma levels. Previously established cutpoints classified AD status (""AD+"", ""AD-"", or ""Intermediate"").

ResultsPlasma p-tau217/A{beta}42had the strongest association with known AD-related factors - MCI, ADD, future progression to MCI/ADD, age, and APOE {varepsilon}4 - compared to p-tau217 and A{beta}42/A{beta}40. Plasma p-tau217/A{beta}42 was also associated with eGFR, diabetes, and history of hearing loss. Importantly, AD-related factors were most frequent/severe for AD+ classification by p-tau217/A{beta}42, while medical morbidities were most frequent/severe for Intermediate classification. Exploratory analyses test p-tau217/A{beta}42 adjusted for eGFR to eliminate its influence on plamsa levels.

InterpretationIn this real-world dataset, we identified effects of multimorbidities on plasma biomarkers, especially kidney function. The p-tau217/A{beta}42 ratio had low rates of Intermediate classification and may help to account for multimorbidity effects on plasma levels.",2025-08-19,Medrxiv,,,,5.4,"Alzheimer's disease, dementia, amyloid, tau, plasma",https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.16.25333799,,10.1101/2025.08.16.25333799

As the most common cause of senile dementia, AD currently affects approximately 50 million people worldwide, with projections indicating a threefold increase by 2050 due to rising life expectancy and an aging global population. Diagnosis of AD remains challenging. Neuroimaging techniques reveal atrophy in critical brain regions, particularly in the cortex, hippocampus, and limbic system, which are essential substrates for memory, personality changes, and other cognitive functions. The hallmark molecular changes associated with AD include the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques and the formation of tau protein tangles. Several underlying mechanisms contribute to neuron loss, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, microbial dysbiosis, and insulin resistance. In this context, exosomes-small extracellular vesicles that facilitate cell communication-transport proteins, DNA, mRNA, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA), all of which play a significant role in the neurobiology of AD. Furthermore, emerging research indicates that exosomal ncRNAs may serve as promising biomarkers for AD, offering the possibility of improved diagnostic precision. This review explores the potential of exosomal ncRNAs-specifically circular RNAs and microRNAS-as non-invasive biomarkers for AD, highlighting recent advances and future directions in translational studies.",2025-08-25,PubMed,International journal of molecular sciences,26,17,5.2,"Alzheimer's disease, dementia, amyloid, tau, brain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40943171/,40943171,10.3390/ijms26178246
