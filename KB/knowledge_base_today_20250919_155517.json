          "abstract": "A neurodegenerative condition called Alzheimer's disease (AD) is brought on by the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. As of right now, AD has no known cure. The only thing the medications on the market can do is slow their development. Nonetheless, nanotechnology has demonstrated its superiority in its application in medicine. It has great promise for AD therapy, mostly in diagnosing the ailment and offering a different treatment method. Penetrating and bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) increases the effectiveness of drug delivery. The most recent advancements in AD diagnosis using nanotechnology based on nanoparticles with optical sensing, electrochemical sensing, and imaging approaches are summarised in this study. When treating AD, nanocarriers help deliver the targeted medication. Since one of the newest and most active treatments for AD is nanomedicines, the main goal of this review is to comprehend the sophisticated application of nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in AD treatment.",

          "abstract": "In the context of global aging, mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is present in 48.9% of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MBI, a neurobehavioral syndrome in the elderly, is an independent risk factor for cognitive decline and is closely related to peripheral blood biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, offering new diagnostic and interventional avenues for early MCI. To summarize evidence on peripheral blood biomarkers related to MBI and their underlying mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, tau pathology, and oxidative stress, a systematic review of studies published between 2015 and 2024 was conducted. MBI is closely associated with peripheral blood biomarker changes. Neuroinflammatory markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light indicate astrocyte activation and neural circuit disruption, with glial fibrillary acidic protein levels correlating with impulse dyscontrol scores. Chitinase-3-like protein 1, a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity, exacerbates neuroinflammation and is linked to depressive symptoms and hippocampal atrophy. Elevated phosphorylated tau proteins in blood correlate with brain tau deposition, increasing the risk of MBI and impairing cognition. Oxidative stress markers damage neurons and disrupt neurotransmission, and concurrent alterations in malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase levels significantly elevate the risk of MBI. The correlation between MBI and biomarkers offers new diagnostic and interventional directions for early MCI. Future research should standardize MBI assessment, conduct longitudinal studies, explore biomarker-MBI relationships, investigate psychosocial impacts, and develop advanced detection methods.",

          "abstract": "Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that binds potentially toxic metal ions and is crucial for neuronal vulnerability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus, potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed-metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.",

          "authors": "Manel Krouma, Basile Kerleroux, Beatrice Desnous...",
          "abstract": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but potentially serious condition in children, with the risk of permanent vision loss in rapidly progressing or treatment-resistant cases. One diagnostic challenge is that cerebellar tonsillar descent-a feature sometimes seen in IIH-can mimic Chiari I malformation, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary, risky surgery. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), who presented with rapidly worsening visual symptoms and severe papilledema over the course of a few days. Initial brain MRI excluded other causes of increased intracranial pressure, raising suspicion for IIH. The imaging also revealed cerebellar tonsillar descent, initially suggesting a possible Chiari I malformation. However, additional MRI findings were more consistent with IIH than Chiari I, including an arachnoidocele of the sella, flattening of the posterior sclera, and bilateral transverse sinus stenosis. A cerebral venography confirmed significant venous outflow obstruction, with a high-pressure gradient across the stenotic transverse sinuses. Based on these findings, venous sinus stenting was performed as a first-line treatment. This resulted in rapid symptom improvement, with complete resolution of headache and papilledema on follow-up. MRI plays a critical role in diagnosis-not only in excluding other conditions but also in positively identifying IIH, especially in atypical and fulminant presentations. When medical treatment fails, surgical options include CSF shunting or increasingly, venous sinus stenting, particularly when venous sinus stenosis is present. Though commonly used in adults, this approach is showing promise in pediatric patients as well, despite some specific challenges. Early diagnosis, appropriate imaging, and a multidisciplinary approach are essential to prevent vision loss and ensure the best possible outcomes in these complex pediatric cases.",

          "abstract": "The natural polyphenol \"Chrysin,\" an antianxiety compound, has limited brain uptake due to the restricted crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we formulated Chrysin-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) and Tween 80-coated CNPs (cCNPs) to improve Chrysin's uptake in the brain and enhance the antianxiety effects. The CNP and cCNP nanoformulations were physicochemically characterized for calculating their particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), drug entrapment efficiency (EE %), and zeta potential. Further, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in vitro release studies were performed. The obtained results indicated the reduced particle size of cCNP NPs (174.40 Â± 2.51 nm) compared to CNPs (197.67 Â± 4.94 nm) and showed an increased EE for cCNPs (86.8%) compared to CNPs (82.73%). The zeta potential of cCNPs was calculated to be -14.4 Â± 1.20 mV, in contrast to +12.3 Â± 0.50 mV for CNPs. TEM images exhibited the presence of spherical cCNPs. In vivo studies revealed a higher time in the light compartment in the light-dark model and increased time spent in the open arm in elevated and maze models. This demonstrates significantly enhanced antianxiety effects of cCNPs compared to CNPs and pure Chrysin. These findings were further validated by the significant reduction in plasma nitrite levels, without any impact on locomotor activity. Additionally, histopathological evaluation of liver, kidney, and brain tissues confirmed the safety of cCNPs, with no significant structural changes observed. This study augments the therapeutic efficacy of cCNPs through enhanced brain uptake by reduced particle size and facilitating adsorptive transcytosis.",

          "abstract": "Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline that interferes with daily functioning, particularly in the elderly. As one of the leading causes of disability among older adults, dementia remains a significant public health concern. Emerging evidence suggests that certain vitamins may play a crucial role in the prevention and management of cognitive impairment. This review explores the potential impact of key micronutrients specifically water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and B-complex (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12), and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K on dementia pathogenesis and cognitive function. Vitamin B deficiencies have been associated with brain atrophy, an early indicator of cognitive decline, and supplementation has shown promise in enhancing memory and slowing brain shrinkage. Similarly, vitamin C exhibits antioxidative properties that may protect against neurodegeneration. While nutritional support, particularly through micronutrient intake, is increasingly considered a viable strategy for cognitive preservation, findings from epidemiological and clinical studies remain mixed. These inconsistencies highlight the need for further research to determine optimal dosing, efficacy, and long-term impact of vitamin supplementation in dementia prevention. A well-balanced diet rich in essential vitamins may support brain health, but individual variability suggests the importance of personalized nutritional interventions. This review underscores the potential role of vitamins in maintaining cognitive health and calls for continued investigation into their therapeutic utility in delaying or preventing dementia.",

Using blinded manual chart reviews, we identified an association between ADRD risk scores and probable ADRD diagnosis at the time the scores were generated. However, it was unclear whether these scores were associated with future ADRD diagnoses and mortality.ObjectiveTo evaluate whether ADRD risk scores are associated with subsequent ADRD incidence and all-cause mortality among BA and WA Veterans without a prior ADRD diagnosis.MethodsWe conducted survival analyses to assess the association between baseline ADRD risk scores and time to either ADRD diagnosis or death. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models, treating death as a competing risk, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were stratified by race and conducted separately for BA and WA Veterans.ResultsHigher ADRD risk scores were significantly associated with increased risk of developing an ADRD diagnosis (HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.72-2.27 for BAs; HR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.79-2.54 for WAs) and mortality (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.40-1.65 for BAs; HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.42-1.69 for WAs).ConclusionsIn addition to identifying undiagnosed cases, ML-derived ADRD risk scores are associated with increased risks of developing future ADRD and mortality, which supports their potential utility for both early detection and prognosis.",

          "abstract": "Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that range in Size from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, have emerged as crucial mediators of intercellular communication within the central nervous system (CNS). They play significant roles in the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, depression, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Exosomes carry a diverse cargo of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other bioactive molecules that can influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. In disease states, exosomes derived from stressed neurons or glial cells can propagate neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. They may also mediate the spread of abnormal proteins or microRNAs, disrupting neuronal connectivity and neurotransmitter signaling and contributing to the development of proteinopathies and neurotoxicity. Owing to their presence in bodily fluids such as blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva, exosomes hold promise as biomarkers for these disorders. Moreover, their regulatory roles present new opportunities for developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. This review provides an overview of the multifaceted roles of exosomes in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We delve into their contributions to disease pathogenesis, their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, and the innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging exosome-based delivery systems. By exploring the current state of research, we aim to highlight the translational potential of exosomes in revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",

Enzymatic PET hydrolysis offers a sustainable solution, but efficient high-throughput screening tools for PET-degrading enzymes remain limited. Here, we report a genetically encoded biosensor (GEB) for terephthalic acid (TPA)âthe primary monomer released during PET degradationâthat enables rapid and sensitive detection of enzymatic activity.
