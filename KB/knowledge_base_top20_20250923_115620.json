          "abstract": "A workgroup assembled by the Alzheimer's Association recently described a conceptual framework for Alzheimer's disease biological staging based on amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, specific tau PET cut points were left to be determined, a step necessary prior to clinical application. We sought to operationalize and evaluate Alzheimer's disease biological staging by identifying meaningful tau PET cut points to define the four biological stages in a well-characterized participant cohort and describe the features of individuals placed into the different biological stages. The primary analysis included 896 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center longitudinal cohorts. A validation cohort consisted of 328 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Both cognitively normal and impaired individuals with positive amyloid PET and evaluable tau PET imaging were included. Tau PET cut points were identified with Gaussian Mixture Models to characterize Alzheimer's disease biological stage in study participants with different clinical diagnoses and objective degrees of cognitive impairment as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination. A tau PET cut point in the medial temporal region and two cut points in the temporoparietal region were identified to collectively produce the four Alzheimer's disease biological stages described in the revised criteria. Increasing stage was associated with greater likelihood of mild cognitive impairment and dementia diagnosis and worsening cognitive performance on Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, a result that was reproduced in the independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. This study provided empiric validation for the concept of using amyloid PET and tau PET to separate subjects with biomarker-proven Alzheimer's disease into four biological stages with distinct characteristics.",

          "authors": "Mominul Islam, Mohammad Junayed Hasan, M R C Mahdy",
          "abstract": "The automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using 3D volumetric MRI data is a complex, multi-domain challenge that has traditionally been addressed by training classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With the rise of quantum computing and its potential to replace classical systems in the future, there is a growing need to: (i) develop automated systems for AD detection that run on quantum computers, (ii) explore the capabilities of current-generation classical-quantum architectures, and (iii) identify their potential limitations and advantages. To reduce the complexity of multi-domain expertise while addressing the emerging demands of quantum-based automated systems, our contribution in this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a simple preprocessing framework that converts 3D MRI volumetric data into 2D slices. Second, we propose CQ-CNN, a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)-based lightweight hybrid classical-quantum convolutional neural network that leverages the computational capabilities of both classical and quantum systems. Our experiments on the OASIS-2 dataset reveal a significant limitation in current hybrid classical-quantum architectures, as they face difficulties converging when class images are highly similar, such as between moderate dementia and non-dementia classes of AD, which leads to gradient failure and optimization stagnation. However, when convergence is achieved, the quantum model demonstrates a promising quantum advantage by attaining state-of-the-art accuracy with far fewer parameters than classical models. For instance, our [Formula: see text]-3-qubit model achieves 97.5% accuracy using only 13.7K parameters (0.05 MB), which is 5.67% higher than a classical model with the same parameter count. Nevertheless, our results highlight the need for improved quantum optimization methods to support the practical deployment of hybrid classical-quantum models in AD detection and related medical imaging tasks.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative condition caused by misfolded prion proteins. It most commonly presents with rapidly progressive dementia and neurological deterioration. While psychiatric symptoms are not unusual in the early stages of CJD, it is very uncommon for the disease to begin with manic features as the primary presentation. CASE REPORT We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who initially developed symptoms consistent with mania. These included an elevated mood, emotional instability, and insomnia. Over time, her clinical condition worsened, and she began to experience hallucinations, along with a noticeable motor decline. Due to the atypical nature of her initial symptoms, she was first treated for viral encephalitis, which contributed to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis. Subsequent investigations played a key role in clarifying the underlying pathology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed characteristic findings of CJD, including cortical ribboning and changes in the basal ganglia. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed periodic sharp-wave complexes, further supporting the diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis tested positive for prion protein using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), confirming a final diagnosis of sporadic CJD (sCJD). CONCLUSIONS Although rare, mania can be an early sign of CJD. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges that arise when psychiatric symptoms dominate the initial clinical picture. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating new-onset psychiatric symptoms in older adults, especially when these symptoms are accompanied by a rapid decline in cognition or motor function. Early consideration of CJD in such scenarios may help expedite diagnosis, avoid unnecessary treatments, and provide clarity for patients and families facing a progressive and life-limiting illness.",

          "authors": "Ersin Haciyakupoglu, Evren Yüvrük, Dervis Mansuri Yilmaz...",
          "abstract": "Objective The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of autologous plasma used as an alternative to duraplasty Materials and Methods We operated 21 patients and 8 New Zealand Rabbits and performed duraplasty with autologous blood. First heparin was added to autologous blood withdrawn from the patient/ rabbit, The sample was then centrifuged to obtain plasma. protamine sulfate was added to the plasma This mixture was then applied to the dural space and tumor cavity, resulting in fibrin formation within 2-3 minutes. All 21 patient had MRI scans 1 month after surgery to show neodura formation. 3 of our patients and all rabbit subjects were operated at least a month later and the biopsie was taken to show the neodura formation microsopically. Results In MRI scans, as well as in biopsies, we have detected the neodura formation. In rabbits that underwent experimental craniotomy and duratomy, neodura had formed as a weak, thin membrane that did not show continuity into the defect area after one month. In the control group, the distribution of collagen fibers appeared relatively normal in areas close to the intact dura. However, further from this area, the regular structure was disrupted, edematous areas had formed in the fibrous layers, and bone fragments were separated from the endosteal layer Conclusion The hypothesis of this study was that plasma obtained from the patient's own arterial blood could serve as an alternative to traditional duraplasty materials. Plasma possesses many of the properties required for duraplasty material and can be a cost-effective, readily available option. Results demonstrate that autologous plasma does not induce significant histological changes and shows excellent biocompatibility with brain parenchyma. Therefore, autologous plasma can be considered a reliable and safe tissue sealant. It is easy to prepare and apply, remains stable in the operating room for 1-2 hours, and can be adjusted in size and thickness according to the dural defect and tumor cavity dimensions. SUMMARY Duraplasty is performed in the following cases: a.) When there are duramater tears of traumatic, spontaneous, or iatrogenic origin, or when associated with tumor invasion. b.) When primary suturing cannot be performed on the thinned duramater due to increased intracranial pressure, edema, contusion, or swelling. c.) When a drain is required for oozing bleeding of the parenchyma. d.) When compressive duratomy, craniotomy, or lobectomy has been performed. e.) In cases with pseudoencephalocele. f.) When constructive adaptation of the dura is required, such as in Chiari malformation. Since the 1800s, numerous allogeneic (homologous), xenogenic (heterologous), autologous, and biosynthetic graft materials have been used in duraplasty. However, none of these materials have proven to be superior to others. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use plasma obtained from the arterial blood of each subject as an alternative for duraplasty to fill dura defects and tumor cavities. Key words: Duraplasty, plasma, neodura, CSF leakageCraniectomy and duratomy were performed, followed by duraplasty using autologous arterial plasma. Brain and neodura biopsies were taken after one month. No significant complications developed. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed one month later to check for the formation of neodura. The results of light and electron microscopy examinations demonstrated that arterial plasma could be an alternative to traditional duraplasty methods.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly recognized as complex disorders involving multiple protein pathologies, with α-synuclein frequently observed beyond classical synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Recent advances in seed amplification assays (SAAs) have enabled the highly sensitive and specific detection of misfolded α-synuclein in vivo, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This review focuses on CSF-based α-synuclein SAAs and their application in detecting co-pathology across non-synucleinopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, and traumatic brain injury. Evidence indicates a role for α-synuclein in clinical heterogeneity and disease progression. Emerging diagnostic frameworks increasingly support integrating co-pathologies into classification and therapeutic strategies. Addressing key knowledge gaps, such as α-synuclein interactions with other protein pathologies, and current limitations of α-syn SAA, such as the lack of quantification of misfolded α-synuclein seeds, will refine precision medicine and improve outcomes for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition and continues to pose significant clinical and research challenges due to its complex causes and limited treatment success. Conventional therapies have primarily focused on amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, but these efforts have yet to produce optimal results. This review explores emerging interdisciplinary strategies that integrate artificial intelligence (AI), small molecule drugs, and precision treatments to tackle AD's intricacies. AI has significantly enhanced early detection, neuroimaging, and biomarker discovery using machine learning and deep learning. These state-of-art methods helps to analyze biomarker profiles and imaging data, thereby enabling tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individual patients. At the same time, computational methods have expedited the development of small molecules targeting Aβ buildup, tau pathology, and inflammation. Emerging treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, RNA-based therapies, and nanotechnology, provide promising alternatives to conventional approaches. The integration of AI with multi-omics and structure-guided drug design supports the creation of precise, individualized treatments. However, challenges in ethics, regulation, and clinical application persist. This review emphasizes the collaborative potential of AI, pharmacology, and biomedical engineering in revolutionizing AD treatment, highlighting the need for cross-disciplinary efforts to confront this urgent neurological condition.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, currently affecting over 50 million people globally. Despite decades of research, therapeutic development has continued to face high failure rates due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. Current drugs like rivastigmine focus on managing cognitive symptoms since there is no known cure to halt the disease's progression. However, recent research has suggested that advanced biological age, particularly the accumulation of senescent cells, is the most significant risk factor for AD pathology, and targeting these aging mechanisms may prove more effective in altering the disease progression. Senescent cells accumulate with age, contributing to inflammatory states and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib and quercetin (D + Q), have shown promise in animal models by clearing senescent cells, delaying aging-related decline, and improving AD-related outcomes. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the therapeutic potential of senolytic interventions for AD by examining the mechanisms of cellular senescence based on evidence of its accumulation in the human brain, critically analyzing the preclinical and clinical trials involving senolytic compounds, and discussing the implications and limitations of this approach. The findings from recent studies indicate that senolytics may pave the way for effective AD treatments, though further clinical validation is needed.",

It has great promise for AD therapy, mostly in diagnosing the ailment and offering a different treatment method. Penetrating and bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) increases the effectiveness of drug delivery. The most recent advancements in AD diagnosis using nanotechnology based on nanoparticles with optical sensing, electrochemical sensing, and imaging approaches are summarised in this study. When treating AD, nanocarriers help deliver the targeted medication. Since one of the newest and most active treatments for AD is nanomedicines, the main goal of this review is to comprehend the sophisticated application of nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in AD treatment.",

          "abstract": "The accumulation of pathological markers, such as tau tangles and amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and progressive cognitive dysfunction are the markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of successful therapeutic plans requires exposure to the molecular mechanisms underlying AD development. The importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in controlling gene expression and influencing the pathophysiology of disease has been brought to light by recent studies. With a focus on their role in important processes such tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-beta formation, this study attempts to give a thorough overview of the several types of ncRNAs and their dysregulation in AD. The genetic variants that are associated with the function of ncRNA including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence ncRNA expression and activity, thereby impacting the susceptibility of individual towards AD. Furthermore, the impact of biomarkers of ncRNAs for early diagnosis and therapeutic option for intervention, highlighting most recent advancement in high-throughput technologies and bioinformatics facilitating ncRNA profiling has also being discussed. The integration of multi-omics approaches and artificial intelligence, new advancement for the complex relationship among ncRNAs and AD pathology are also discussed. The enhancement and understanding of ncRNAs could lead to the door for novel therapeutic concepts for the mitigation of AD progression, offering effective interventions in a disease that currently starves the curative treatments.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and chronic neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Currently available treatments are liable to provide symptomatic relief; hence, researchers are focused on finding some novel molecular targets for developing targeted therapies, and also some biomarkers for early detection. Emerging evidence suggests that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) serves as a key regulator of microglial activation, exhibiting both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on the stage of disease. The overexpression of Gal-3 leads to increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, accelerating disease progression while initially promoting Aβ clearance and suppressing immune response. Moreover, Gal-3 has been associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, hence exacerbating synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage. Elevated levels of Gal-3 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum correlate with disease severity, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Establishing Gal-3 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic target, several preclinical studies indicate their ability to lower Aβ and tau accumulation by regulating pro-inflammatory signaling and enhancing clearance mechanisms. This approach reduces neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial activation and improves cognitive function by preserving neuronal function and lowering oxidative stress. This review is intended to discuss the intricate role of Gal-3 in AD pathology, such as Aβ aggregation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and microglial activation. Further, it explores the therapeutic strategies that Gal-3 could serve as a novel biomarker for tracing the disease, and reviews potential therapeutic approaches through Gal-3 inhibition for AD management.",
