By employing a ZIC-HILIC LC-MS/MS platform, the lipidome of AD (",

These insoluble aggregates are found in the brain of those affected by Alzheimer's disease and other related tauopathies. Hyperphosphorylation of tau in disease has been hypothesized to cause tau to dissociate from microtubules and form amyloid-like oligomers and fibrils. Under normal conditions, there is 2-3 mol of phosphate per mole of tau; however, studies have found 2-3 times more phosphate per mole of tau in diseased conditions. The",
