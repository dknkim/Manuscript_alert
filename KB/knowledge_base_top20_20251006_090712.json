          "authors": "Chaitali Anand, Farras Abdelnour, Benjamin Sipes...",
          "abstract": "Brain regions in Alzheimer's disease exhibit distinct vulnerability to its hallmark pathology with the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus succumbing early to tau tangles while others like the primary sensory cortices remain resilient. The quest to understand how local/regional genetic factors, pathogenesis and network-mediated pathology spread, together govern this selective vulnerability (SV) or resilience (SR) is ongoing. Although many Alzheimer's risk genes are known from gene association and transgenic studies, it is still unclear whether and how their baseline expression confers SV/SR to pathology. Prior analyses have yielded conflicting results, pointing to a disconnect between the location of genetic risk factors and downstream tau pathology. The spatial distribution of vulnerability doesn't always align with genetic factors, suggesting a role for non-cell-autonomous mechanisms like transneuronal tau transmission. We hypothesize that a full accounting of the role of genes in mediating SV/SR would require modelling of network-based vulnerability, whereby tau misfolds, aggregates and propagates along fibre projections. We employed an extended network diffusion model (eNDM) and fitted it on tau PET data from 196 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The fitted eNDM then becomes a reference from which to assess the role of innate genetic factors. Using the residual (observed - model-predicted) tau as a novel target outcome, we obtained its association with 100 Alzheimer's risk genes, whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Our eNDM was successful in capturing tau pathology distribution in patients. After regressing out the model, we found that while many risk genes have spatial expression patterns that correlate with regional tau, many others showed a stronger association with residual tau. This suggests that direct vulnerability aligned with the network, as well as network-independent vulnerability, are conferred by risk genes. We report four classes of risk genes: network-aligned SV (SV-NA), network-independent SV (SV-NI), network-aligned SR (SR-NA) and network-independent SR (SR-NI), each with a distinct spatial signature and associated vulnerability to tau. Remarkably, using gene ontology analysis, we found that the identified gene classes have distinct and sometimes surprising functional enrichment patterns. Network-aligned genes broadly participate in cell death, stress response and metabolic processing; network-independent genes in amyloid-β processing and immune response. These previously unreported segregated roles point to multiple distinct pathways by which risk genes confer vulnerability or resilience in Alzheimer's disease. Our findings offer new insights into vulnerability signatures in Alzheimer's disease and may prove helpful in identifying potential intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular Tau determines the progression of Alzheimer's disease, yet therapeutic strategies targeting it are hindered by poor brain delivery and limited clearance. Here we developed a Tau-clearing cell therapy based on monocytes functionalized with a high-affinity Tau-specific aptamer. The aptamer was covalently conjugated to the surface of monocytes (derived from bone marrow leucocytes and cultured under monocyte-inducing conditions) via bioorthogonal chemistry without affecting their viability or function. Upon intravenous administration in mice expressing mutant and disease-relevant human Tau, the engineered monocytes actively crossed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in Tau-rich brain regions such as the hippocampus and striatum. They efficiently phagocytosed extracellular Tau, leading to a significant reduction in Tau burden. As a result, glial activation was suppressed, neuroinflammation was alleviated, and neuronal and mitochondrial integrity was preserved. Long-term treatment improved memory and spatial learning, without inducing toxicity or behavioural side effects. These results demonstrate that aptamer-guided monocytes can achieve targeted delivery, effective clearance and sustained neuroprotection, offering a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.",

In this field, 'brain age gap' has emerged as a promising magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarker that quantifies the deviation between an individual's biological and chronological age of the brain. Here we conducted an in-depth genomic analysis of the brain age gap and its relationships with over 1,000 health traits. Genome-wide analyses in up to 56,348 individuals unveiled a heritability of 23-29% attributable to common genetic variants and highlighted 59 associated loci (39 novel). The leading locus encompasses MAPT, encoding the tau protein central to Alzheimer's disease. Genetic correlations revealed relationships with mental health, physical health, lifestyle and socioeconomic traits, including depressed mood, diabetes, alcohol intake and income. Mendelian randomization indicated a causal role of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in accelerated brain aging.

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a specific neurodegenerative disorder, distinct from normal aging, with a growing unmet medical need. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, primarily consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils. Therapeutic antibodies can slow down the disease, but are associated with potential severe side effects, motivating the development of small molecules to halt disease progression. This study investigates the interaction between the clinical drug candidate small molecule anle138b and lipidic Aβ₄₀ fibrils of type 1 (L1). L1 fibrils were previously shown to closely resemble fibrils from Alzheimer's patients. Using high-resolution structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that anle138b selectively binds to a cavity within the fibril. This structural insight provides a deeper understanding of a potential drug-binding mechanism at the atomic level and may inform the development of therapies and diagnostic approaches. In addition, anle138b reduces fibril formation in the presence of lipids by approximately 75%. This may suggest a mechanistic connection to its previously reported activity in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.",

Yet, the therapeutic options for addressing the disease pathogenesis are limited. Here, we report an approach by targeting brain nucleoside homeostasis and energy metabolism to alleviate AD-associated cognitive deficits. A compound, J4, was designed to modulate nucleoside homeostasis by interacting with the equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1). The effects of J4 on brain nucleoside homeostasis and energy metabolism were examined in mice. Two AD animal models, THY-Tau22 and APP/PS1 mice, were used to evaluate the translational potential of J4 for the treatment of AD. Cognitive function and functional ability were assessed using the Morris water maze, Y-maze, and nesting behavior tests. The pharmacodynamic marker was explored, and the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of J4 were evaluated. As a result, being administered after disease onset, oral J4 administration rescued memory and cognitive dysfunction in both tau and amyloid AD mouse models. Metabolomic analysis showed that J4 increased brain nucleoside levels and facilitated brain primary metabolism, including glucose metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway. The [",

In this context, the interaction between tau and APOE, particularly the main genetic risk factor for AD APOE ε4, remains underexplored. APOE encodes apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein important in lipid metabolism. In addition to promoting Aβ deposition, emerging evidence suggests that APOE ε4 exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration and tau-related pathology. This review consolidates current knowledge on the interplay between apoE and tau, highlighting its potential as a key factor in disease progression.

          "abstract": "Ischaemic strokes disrupt brain networks, leading to remote effects in key regions like the thalamus, a critical hub for brain functions. However, non-invasive methods to quantify these remote consequences still need to be explored. This study aimed to demonstrate that MRI-derived R2* changes can capture iron accumulation linked with inflammation secondary to stroke-induced disconnection. To link remote R2* changes to stroke-induced disconnection, we first conducted a secondary analysis of 156 prospectively included stroke patients who underwent MRI at baseline and 1-year follow-up. We mapped fibres disconnected by baseline infarcts to compare the R2* changes over 1 year according to the disconnectivity status in specific thalamic nuclei groups. We also identified the variables associated with elevated R2* at 1 year in a multivariate context through linear regressions. In parallel, to understand the biological underpinning of the remote R2* changes, we set up a translational mouse model through photothrombotic induction of focal cortical infarcts or sham procedures in 110 C57BL/6J mice. We explored the mice through combinations of in vivo MRI at 72 h, 2-, 4- and 8-weeks, histology, qPCR for gene expression, mass spectrometry for iron concentration quantification and additional ex vivo high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging. In stroke patients, we found a significant increase of R2* within severely disconnected medial and lateral thalamic nuclei groups from baseline to 1 year. At the same time, no change occurred if these structures were not disconnected. We also showed that the disconnectivity status at baseline was significantly associated with R2* at follow-up, independently from confounders, establishing a direct and independent relationship between baseline disconnection and the subsequent R2* increase within the associated locations. In mice, we recapitulated the patients' conditions by observing increased R2* in the stroke groups, specifically within the disconnected thalamic nuclei. Such remote and focal R2* changes peaked at 2 weeks, preceding and correlating with longer-term atrophy at 8 weeks. We established that the remote R2* increase was spatially and temporally correlated with a significant increase of chemically determined iron load bound to ferritin within activated microglial cells. This study provides critical evidence that R2* is a sensitive marker of inflammation secondary to network disconnection, potentially informing future neuroprotective strategies targeting remote brain regions after stroke.",

Despite significant research, the limited efficacy of current treatments underscores the critical need to identify novel pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Necroptosis, a regulated and highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, has emerged as one of the key contributors to AD pathogenesis. This systematic review comprises 25 high-quality in vivo, in vitro, and autopsy studies, published between 2015 and 2025, extracted from PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The keywords include \"necroptosis\", \"RIPK1\", \"RIPK3\", \"MLKL\", \"pMLKL\", \"necroptosis inhibitors\", \"Alzheimer's disease\", and \"neurodegeneration\". The review summarizes the multiple molecular mechanisms, including TNF-α/TNFR1 signaling, TRIF-mediated RIPK3 activation, and RHIM-dependent MLKL phosphorylation, associated with necroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD. All the studies converge on necroptosis as a central pathogenic pathway linking key molecular and cellular abnormalities observed in AD. The accumulated evidence strongly supports prioritizing the development of brain-penetrant necroptosis inhibitors and clinical validation of associated biomarkers. These insights signal a significant shift in AD therapeutics, moving from symptomatic treatment to mechanistically targeted interventions that can alter disease progression.",
